{% include figure.html img="Science LM-7877.jpg" alt="Student in science laboratory" caption="Science Laboratory" width="50%" %}

## Aims and topics

This tutorial is a collection of resources to help researchers move towards reproducibility. 

Some scenarios to consider:

1.
A key person from your research team has disappeard (family or personal emergency or no longer contactable). 
- Could you continue your work? 
- Do you know where your data is stored? 
- Could you keep working effectively for 1 month? 1 year?

2.
You lose your laptop bag containing your external hard drives. 
- Could you continue your work? 
- Is your data backed up? Encrypted?

3.
Someone has published contradicting results to your published paper, and you've been asked to provide your data and methods. 
- Could you?

4. 
A research partner organization believes your "sensitive" data has been made available to others (ie a data breach). 
- Could you show that steps were taken to avoid this or show that it couldn't happen?

## Audience

This workshop is aimed at researchers and research students.
