# Ten Reproducible Research Things

{% include figure.html img="sciencelab.jpg" alt="Student in science laboratory" caption="Science Laboratory" width="75%" %}

## Aims and topics

A collection of resources to help researchers move along the path in reproducibility. You won't go from 0 – 100 but if you can implement one or two things, it can help you later down the track. The ‘be better than you were yesterday’ idea.

The ten things can help answer these questions or scenarios that are possible in any research project or lab, including:

Q1) What if a key person from your lab disappeared one day (family or personal emergency, no longer contactable)? Could you all continue your work? Would you know where all your data is stored? Could you keep running effectively for 1 month? 1 year?

- Bus factor
- Documentation
- Naming conventions
- Folder structure for readability
- Automation
- git for version control (?)

Q2) Imagine you're travelling and lose your laptop bag with your external hard drives? Or your office is robbed? Could you continue your work? Is your data backed up? Encrypted? Solutions include:

- Research storage
- Security- encrypt your hard drive
- Separating identified variables

Q3) Someone has published contradicting results to your published paper, and you've been asked to provide your data and methods. Could you? Solutions include:

- Research Storage – Vault
- Publish your final state data in a repository
- Documentation
- Versions of software
- Keep raw data separate (Research Storage – Vault)

Q4) If a research partner organization believes your "sensitive" data has been made available to others (ie a data breach). Could you show that steps were taken to avoid this or show that it couldn't happen? Solutions include:

- Research space – to trace who you have shared a file with
- Computer encryption (General good computer safety)
- General good computer safety – unique passwords and use Multi factor Authentication when possible
- Separating identified variables

## Audience

This workshop is aimed at researchers and research students.
