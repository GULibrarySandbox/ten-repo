# Ten Reproducible Research Things

{% include figure.html img="Science LM-7877.jpg" alt="Student in science laboratory" caption="Science Laboratory" width="75%" %}

## Aims and topics

A collection of resources to help researchers move along the path towards reproducibility. 

The ten things can help answer these questions or scenarios that are possible in any research project or lab, including:

Q1) What if a key person from your lab disappeared one day (family or personal emergency, no longer contactable)? Could you all continue your work? Would you know where all your data is stored? Could you keep running effectively for 1 month? 1 year?

Q2) Imagine you're travelling and lose your laptop bag with your external hard drives? Or your office is robbed? Could you continue your work? Is your data backed up? Encrypted?

Q3) Someone has published contradicting results to your published paper, and you've been asked to provide your data and methods. Could you?

Q4) If a research partner organization believes your "sensitive" data has been made available to others (ie a data breach). Could you show that steps were taken to avoid this or show that it couldn't happen?

## Audience

This workshop is aimed at researchers and research students.
