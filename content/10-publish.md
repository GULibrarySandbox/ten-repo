At the end of your project, make your research data [findable, accessible, interoperable and re-useable (F.A.I.R)](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/fair-data/) using a Persistant Identifier (PiD) such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).

{% capture text %}
#### Identifiers

An identifier is any label used to name an item (whether digital or physical).  URLs and serial numbers are an examples of digital identifiers. 

Personal names are also identifiers, but are not necessarily unique as you may share the same name with many other researchers around the world.

{% include figure.html img="Barcodes.png" alt="Serial numbers & URLS" caption="Serial numbers & URLS" width="50%" %}

Management of these digital identifiers is NOT guaranteed:

* links disappear
* websites shut down
* product support ends

#### Persistent Identifiers

Persistent identifiers are a long-lasting unique digital reference to a webpage, digital object, even a person.

Examples include [Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)](https://orcid.org/) and [Digital Object Identifier (DOI)](https://www.doi.org/).

Management is guaranteed:

* links are kept up to date over a defined time period
* links will find the object, even when websites change over time.{% endcapture %}{% include card.html header="Identifiers vs Persistent Identifiers" text=text %}

{% capture text %}
#### A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a unique alphanumeric string that:

* is assigned by either a publisher, organisation or agency 
* identifies content
* provides a **persistent** link to its location or record on the internet and links to other related research output
* facilitates citation and citation metrics 

{% capture text %}
A DOI might look something like this: [http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/01/4F8E15A1B4D89](http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/01/4F8E15A1B4D89)

Other persistent identifies may look like this: [https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/394379](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/394379), an example from [Griffiths' Research Data Repository](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/).{% endcapture %}{% include alert.html text=text color=warning %}

#### DOIs uniquely identify research data and support citation and citation metrics.

#### Key messages:
* DOIs are the globally accepted identification standard for digital scholarly publications, detailing the necessary metadata to support credit and attribution.
* DOIs can be created for Datasets and associated outputs (e.g. grey literature, workflows, algorithms, software etc.) - DOIs for data are equivalent to DOIs for other scholarly publications
* DOIs enable accurate data citation and bibliometrics (both metrics and altmetrics)
* Resolvable DOIs provide easy online access to research data for discovery, attribution and reuse
* Dataset DOIs can be linked using standard metadata schemas to other research output, increasing opportunities to reproduce research.

The examples below show how DOIs connect scholarly publications with supporting datasets.

Ensure data you publish or associate with a publication has a DOI. 

How?
* Deposit final state data to support your publications in an institutional or discipline data repository which can mint a DOI and create a citation for your work. Examples include:
  * [Griffith Research Online (GRO) Data Repository](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/392600) 
  * [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/) registry of discipline and other data repositories
* Contact your Library staff for guidance.{% endcapture %}{% include card.html header="First steps" text=text %}

{% capture text %}
* Learn more about how DOIs [and their use in data citations enables tracking and quantitative measuring of publication impact and data impact.](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2016.00034/full) from Honor et. al.
* Read the [ARDC Data & Software Citation Guide](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/data-and-software-citation/).{% endcapture %}{% include card.html header="Intermediate" text=text %}

{% capture text %}
* Learn more about the [ARDC's policy supporting PiDs](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/ardc-persistent-identifiers-policy/) to improve tracking of research impact, contribute to research integrity and enable research innovation.{% endcapture %}{% include card.html header="Advanced" text=text %}
