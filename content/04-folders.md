Having a standard folder structure can keep your files organised and save you time looking for data.  It can also help if you are sharing files with colleagues and having a standard place to put working data and documentation.

Like files, folders can also follow a naming convention. By prefixing with numbers, you can force your files to be ordered by the steps in your workflow. Probably the simplest way to document your structure - for your future reference - is to add a “README” file - a text file outlining the contents of the folder. 

See what a folder structure might look like in these examples.

To develop a logical structure for your team, consider the following:
* Check that there are no pre-existing folder structure agreements
* Name folders appropriately and in a meaningful manner. Don't use staff names and consider using the type of work
* Consistency - make sure you use the agreed structure/hierarchy 
* Structure folders hierarchically - start with a limited number of folders for the broader topics, and then create more specific folders within these
* Separate ongoing and completed work - as you start to create lots of folders and files, it is a good idea to separate your older documents from those you are currently working on
* Backup – ensure folders and files are backed up and retrievable in the event of a disaster. Griffith, like most universities, has safe storage solutions.
* Clean up and archive folders and files post project.

Pick a dataset and illustrate how you currently organise your files.
(For the artists: Draw a picture that describes your current approach to file organisation)  
See if you can devise a better folder naming convention or note one or two improvements you could make to how you arrange your files.

There are some good folder template shapes around. [Here's one you are welcome to download and use](https://github.com/guereslib/MyResearchProjects/archive/master.zip) (double check with Amanda who created this?)

Or another you could try out from researcher Nikola Vukovic [http://nikola.me/](http://nikola.me/assets/Folder_Template.zip).

Check out this example [README template](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwirpZzmyNL7AhUayTgGHb8tAewQFnoECB8QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Flibrary.sydney.edu.au%2Fresearch%2Fdata-management%2Fdownloads%2FREADME-template.docx&usg=AOvVaw0Z3q0K1PsGivmQY-qNFpZL) from University of Sydney.{% endcapture %}{% include card.html header="First steps" text=text %}

Develop a procedure on folder structures for your team. You could create a template and put it in a downloadable location for them to get them started.

Use a [python package](https://github.com/vukovicnikola/templateproject) developed by researcher Nikola Vukovic to generate a logical, standardised, and flexible directory hierarchy for academic research {% endcapture%}{% include card.html header="Advanced" text=text %}
